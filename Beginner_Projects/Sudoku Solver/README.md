# Sudoku Solver using Python and Tkinter
This script creates a GUI-based Sudoku solver that allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle and find the solution.

## Library Used
* tkinter

### How to install required external modules
* You typically do not need to install `tkinter` separately as it comes with standard Python installations. However, if it is not available, you can install it on your system as follows:

  - **For Ubuntu/Debian**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3-tk
    ```

  - **For Windows**:
    Tkinter is included with the standard Python installation.

  - **For macOS**:
    Tkinter should also be included if you installed Python from the official website.

### How to run the script
- Save the code in a file named `sudoku.py`.
- Execute `python3 sudoku.py`.
